## 📊 How It Works

### **1. Data Preparation & Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)**

The project starts with data preprocessing in a Jupyter Notebook, where we:
- Load datasets, inspect the data, and perform initial exploration.
- Clean the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
- Generate summary statistics and visualize trends in the data using **Plotly**.

### **2. Interactive Dashboard (Python with Dash)**

The dashboard allows users to interact with the data:
- **E-commerce Data**: Users can select product categories from a dropdown menu to filter the dataset.
- **Visualizations**: The selected category is used to display a **bar chart** showing sales per product in that category.

### **3. Real-time Interactivity**

- **🎯 Dropdown Menu**: Allows users to select a category and filter data.
- **📈 Real-time Graphs**: Displays dynamic visualizations based on user selection.
